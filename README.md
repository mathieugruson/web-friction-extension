# FocusFriend: A Personalized Tool to Beat Web Scrolling Addiction

## üöÄ Why I Built FocusFriend

Over the years, I've struggled with web scrolling addiction, constantly getting distracted by infinite feeds and homepages. I've tried countless productivity tools, blockers, and browser extensions, but none really fit my personal workflow or addressed my specific friction points.

I realized that **friction is a personal thing**‚Äîwhat derails one person's focus might be different for another. Instead of forcing myself into one-size-fits-all solutions, I decided to create my own tool, tailored to my needs.

## ‚ú® Features

FocusFriend is designed to strike a balance between **focus** and **flexibility**. It doesn't block the entire internet but instead introduces selective barriers to help you stay intentional online.

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Block Distracting Homepages**
- Example: Block homepages like news sites, social media feeds, or other places where endless scrolling happens.
- **Still want to read that one article?** No problem‚Äîsubpages remain accessible, so you can navigate directly to what you need.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Hide Specific Elements**
- Example: Remove distracting sections like YouTube recommendations, Twitter trends, or similar features designed to grab your attention.
- Customize which parts of a webpage disappear while keeping the rest intact.

## üéØ Why It Works

FocusFriend isn't about total restriction‚Äîit's about **customizing your friction**. By selectively blocking and hiding the things that pull you away from your goals, it helps you:
- Stay intentional with your web usage.
- Focus on specific tasks without feeling completely "cut off."
- Avoid the temptation of mindless scrolling while still enabling productive browsing.

## üöß How It Works

1. **Custom Rules**: Define specific URLs to block or modify (e.g., block `linkedin.com`, but allow `linkedin.com/messaging`).
2. **Element Hiding**: Target and remove specific parts of webpages (e.g., YouTube's "Recommended Videos").
3. **Flexibility**: Modify rules on-the-fly to adapt to your needs.

## üí° Inspiration
